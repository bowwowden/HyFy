# HyFy 

A Project For Translating Common Lisp algorithms into the Hy lisp subset language of Python.

Following the Programming Algorithms by Vsevolod Domkin. I recommend everyone get a copy on leanpub.

This collection will be unique in that it is mostly focused on algorithms and datastructures in Hy.
